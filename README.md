final project - Booking Time

description : Booking Time is a web-based enterprise system designed to digitalize and optimize scheduling processes within a university environment. The platform centralizes office hour bookings, classroom reservations, and administrative monitoring into a single integrated system. The application enables students to book appointments with professors during available office hours through a structured and transparent interface. Professors can manage their availability, control appointment slots, and monitor student bookings. University administrators gain access to an analytics dashboard that provides insights into system usage, resource allocation, and scheduling efficiency.
